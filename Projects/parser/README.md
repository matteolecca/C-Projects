<h1>PARSER</h1>
<section>
<p><strong>
 A parser is a component of a compiler or interpreter, which parses the source code of a computer programming language to create some form of internal representation; the parser is a key step in the compiler frontend. Programming languages tend to be specified in terms of a deterministic context-free grammar because fast and efficient parsers can be written for them. For compilers, the parsing itself can be done in one pass or multiple passes â€“ see one-pass compiler and multi-pass compiler.    </strong><br/>

    Further instruction of the parser implementation can be found in the Parsing.pdf file.
